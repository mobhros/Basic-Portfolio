            I was born in Managua, Nicaragua, and came to the United States at the age of 9. I received my Bachelor’s degree in April
            2014 from Florida International University with a major in history and a minor in political science. I completed
            my MA in Latin American Studies in January 2017 at New York University.

            As an Intern at the British Consulate General DIT in San Francisco, I have gained indispensable hands on experience in the
            inner workings of the British government. In the Department of International Trade, I assisted the department
            writing briefs and Bios on tech companies looking to invest, expand into the UK (FDI). Furthermore, I have sat
            in various client meetings and calls, done considerable research on tech star-ups that can be great candidates
            for Foreign Direct Investment. As a Graduate Assistant at NYU’s Center for Latin American Studies (CLACS), I
            honed my written, verbal communication, and multimedia skills. This position allowed me to further develop my
            communication experience by engaging with various academic and non-academic guest.
