                        I was born in Managua, Nicaragua, and came to the United States at the age of 9. I received my Bachelor’s degree in April
                        2014 from Florida International University with a major in history and a minor in political science.
                        I completed my MA in Latin American Studies in January 2017 at New York University.

                        As an Intern at the British Consulate General DIT in San Francisco, I have gained indispensable hands on experience in the
                        inner workings of the British government. In the Department of International Trade, I assisted the
                        department writing briefs and Bios on tech companies looking to invest, expand into the UK (FDI).
                        Furthermore, I have sat in various client meetings and calls, done considerable research on tech
                        star-ups that can be great candidates for Foreign Direct Investment. As a Graduate Assistant at NYU’s
                        Center for Latin American Studies (CLACS), I honed my written, verbal communication, and multimedia
                        skills. This position allowed me to further develop my communication experience by engaging with
                        various academic and non-academic guests.
